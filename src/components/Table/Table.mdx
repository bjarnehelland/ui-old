# Table

Tables make common actions more obvious and help users more easily perform them. Tables use labels and sometimes icons to communicate the action that will occur when the user touches them.

## Properties

<Props of={Table} />

## Basic usage

<Playground>

  <Table data={sampleData}>Content</Table>
</Playground>
